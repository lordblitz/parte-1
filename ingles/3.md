## Project Setup js

You can find the Node.js installation instructions here.

It is important to know how the Node project works and the way it's constructed.

>Node is working closely with npm, which means that in lots of cases we are going to use npm commands to achieve something in Node.


In order to create a Node project, all we need is **npm init.**  
This command will ask us a few questions and create the package.json file where all the data is stored.

The next step is to install and add the dependencies by using the command **npm install 'package_name' --save.**   
This will both create the node_modules directory (install) and save it inside the package.json for further use.

So far we have the following files and directories: 

>node_modules  
package.json  
package-lock.json
        


Now that the project is set, let's create the .js files to start writing some code. For now, we only need one file named app.js to create and run our server.

```js
 $ touch app.js
 ```


>**You can run any JavaScript code using the node by typing 'node' in the terminal and start writing your code or save your code inside a file and run the script using the node 'file_name.js' command.**
