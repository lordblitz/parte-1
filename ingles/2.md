## npm (Node Package Manager) js

**npm** is the package manager for Node.js, and as we are going to learn about Node, we need to know how to use npm to install, remove, update and do many other operations with packages.

The package **.json file** is the key file for npm package management. It used to set up package dependencies and other things. The package.json is located in the application root directory.

Here are some essential npm commands:


**npm init**  
This will initiate a command line questionnaire that will conclude with the creation of a package.json in the directory in which you initiated the command.

**npm install**  
Install the dependencies in the local node_modules folder reading from package.json.

**npm install** <package_name>  
This will create the node_modules directory in your current directory (if one doesn't exist yet) and will download the package to that directory. The --save option adds the module to the package.json dependencies.

**npm uninstall 'package_name' --save**  
This will remove the package from the node_modules and the package.json file.

**npm install 'package_name' --global**  
This will install the package globally inside the node_modules directory.

**npm update**  
This will update the packages in the node_modules directory and the package.json file.

>**During any operations where npm modifies either the node_modules tree or package.json, the file package-lock.json is generated or modified.**
