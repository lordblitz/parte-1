## Modules `js`

Modules in Node.js are like JS libraries. Moreover, in the Node.js module system, each file is treated as a separate module.

Node has lots of **built-in modules** such as **'http', 'fs', 'path', 'events'** and many more.

To include modules we need the function **'require('name)'**, where the 'name' is the name of the module. It can be used to import built-in, your created modules, and external modules (installed via npm).

## Creating a Module
You can **export** your own modules and import them elsewhere in your project.
The main difference of a module with regular .js file is that you should export what you need from that file (variables, objects, functions, properties, etc.).

For example, let's create a module where it calculates the area of the **circle** and **square** and name the module area.js. We are going to use ES6. If you are not familiar with it, you can learn it **here**.

```js
const { PI } = Math;  
const circle = r => PI * r ** 2;  
const square = a => a ** 2;  
module.exports = {circle, square};  
```

We could export them individually, too: 
```JS
const { PI } = Math;  
exports.circle = r => PI * r ** 2;  
exports.square = a => a ** 2;
```


In order to use this module in another file (app.js for instance), we should import it using require('./area'). 

```js
const area = require('./area');  
console.log(`Area of Circle: ${area.circle(4)}`);  
console.log(`Area of Square: ${area.square(4)}`);  
```


Now you can run your app.js file by using **node app.js.**  
You will see the output:  
**Area of Circle: 50.2654...**  
**Area of Square: 16**  

>**Notice that we are using a relative path, indicated with "./". Your path may change if your module is located in another directory.**
